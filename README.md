# titanic kaggle challenge

<h5>This repo is basically a journal on my journy through  Kagggle's Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaste competition </h5>

<h6>Keep in mind that I have no experience on this particular problem I'm going in clean. </h6>

Day 1 aka March 30, 2021 
I'm still very unsure about the datasets especially because they are already split into training and testing  (That's something I had never encountered before).
Other then that I feeling OK about the procces since I got about 84-87 accuracy
Hopping to learn more about this whole deal trough out the day so that I can do better tomorrow.

Plans for tomorrow:
  1: Try and use more ensemble models
  2: if 1 doesn't work then ill try and change the features that im using
  3: if none of the others work ill watch some videos on the subject
