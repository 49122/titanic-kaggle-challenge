# titanic kaggle challenge

<h5>This repo is basically a journal on my journy through  Kagggle's Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaste competition </h5>

<h6>Keep in mind that I have no experience on this particular problem I'm going in clean. </h6>

Day 1 aka March 30, 2021 
I'm still very unsure about the datasets especially because they are already split into training and testing  (That's something I had never encountered before).
Other then that I feeling OK about the procces since I got about 84-87 accuracy
Hopping to learn more about this whole deal trough out the day so that I can do better tomorrow.

Plans for tomorrow:
  1: Try and use more ensemble models
  2: if 1 doesn't work then ill try and change the features that im using
  3: if none of the others work ill watch some videos on the subject


Day 2, March 31, 2021
So, i was wrong in the way I was using the datasets, after figuring that out and re building my model so that it would actually work 
I uploaded my prediction to kaggle getting 78% accuracy which is not that bad but definitely not good enough.

Plans for tomorrow 
1: Look at the data in more datail and try to get some insights on what might be usefull one of my ideas is to to try and figure out if a family survived together 
and with this information create a new column (feature) for my model
2: Look for more ideas like the one discribed on the last point.
3: if my accuracy is not getting better then I'll look for some help on the internet.

Day 3, April 1, 2021
Today I did a whole lot of reserch and learning about different aproches to the competition I also did a lot of data analysis and feature engineering and thats about it which means taht my score didn't actually get any better, but my knowledge on the subject increased significantly.

Plans for tomorrow 
1: to be honest i dont know the only thing in my mind is to try some of the ML models that I know of and if that doesm's work i guess I'll have to look online for some inspiration.
