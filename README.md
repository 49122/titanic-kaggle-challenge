# titanic-kaggle-challenge

Day 1 aka March 30, 2021:
	I'm still very unsure about the datasets especially because they are already split into training and testing 
	(Thats something I have never encountered before).
	Other then that I feeling OK about the procces since I got about 84-87 accuracy
	Hopping to learn more about this whole deal trough out the day so that I can do better tomorrow.
