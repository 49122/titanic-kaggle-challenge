# titanic kaggle challenge

<h5>This repo is basically a journal on my journy through  Kagggle's Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaste competition =>  [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic "Kaggle") </h5>

Day 1 aka March 30, 2021 
I'm still very unsure about the datasets especially because they are already split into training and testing  (That's something I had never encountered before).
Other then that I feeling OK about the procces since I got about 84-87 accuracy
Hopping to learn more about this whole deal trough out the day so that I can do better tomorrow.
